It started like this: I was a young Software Engineer and I wrote things down. My mentor told me to write things down and that it was a great habit to get into.
“Don’t write everything down”, he said, “just things that are important.”
That way I don’t have to burden myself with remembering everything, instead I can refer to my notebook. Most of these items were little notes about problems I would run into, but always forgot how to solve them.</description>
