Over the years, I have had the pleasure of being a part of the hiring process. My experiences range from being a cog in the wheel of hiring for a massive corporation, and a primary decision-maker for a small start-up.
What makes a good hire? It might not be what you think…
 Get Noticed The first step to getting hired at any job is to get noticed.</description>

It started like this: I was a young Software Engineer and I wrote things down. My mentor told me to write things down and that it was a great habit to get into.
“Don’t write everything down”, he said, “just things that are important.”
That way I don’t have to burden myself with remembering everything, instead I can refer to my notebook. Most of these items were little notes about problems I would run into, but always forgot how to solve them.</description>

Problem In software, naming is often said to be one of the hardest parts. From what I’ve seen, writing tests is right up there too! I see people struggle with tests all the time. They get overwhelmed or frustrated and just skip it, which is a bad thing for everybody.

  Mentor: “Tinkering can be bad, unless you’re tinkering with purpose.</description>
