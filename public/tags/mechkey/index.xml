      <description>The finished build: 65% Lucky Jade mechanical keyboard.
Introduction I wanted to share with you today my latest mechanical keyboard build.
It’s been a little over two years since my last build, and this makes my 3rd full build. I am by no means an expert, but I have been lurking around the hobby for a number of years.
I’ll mention straight away that this build could have gone better. Some things went well; however, there were some rookie mistakes I made early on in the build that would have made for a much softer landing in the end.</description>
